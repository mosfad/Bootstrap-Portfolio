                <p>I am a software development enthusiast and a stay-at-home dad. I have two wonderful children whom I enjoy nuturing and caring for. 
                I am currently attending a coding boot camp at UCR Extension for the Full Stack Flex program, which ends first week in October. 
                I hope to use the skills I will acquire to facilitate my transition from an web development enthusiast to a professional. After a couple of weeks
                in the classs, I can say that I have learnt so much about HTML and CSS. Specifically, I have learnt the various ways to position different elements in
                a webpage and how the concept of positioning is very integral to understanding how to intentionally layout a webpage. </p>
                <p>My background is in electrical engineering, which I studied at the University of Houston. Ironically, I took a few programming courses in college
                which I hated and ultimately struggled in. My interest in programming started to grow well after I graduated from college. A couple of years ago, I 
                started learn programming languages such as Java, Python, R, and C++. I started learning HTML, CSS and Javascript a few months before the coding bootcamp 
                at UCR Extension. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in 2007, I worked as a design engineer with Houston Transformer Company for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>Being an elder millenial, I have different hobbies and interests. For example, I am curious about the technologies that power 
                social media platforms, but I am not active on their websites. I also enjoy playing basketball, watching great shows such as 
                Game of Thrones and spending a lazy afternoon with my wife and kids at the beach. I am excited about the opportunities and experiences ahead of me as I 
                immerse myself into front end and back end web development.</p>
